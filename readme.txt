Game Name: Webpon
Theme 2: Cyber Security
The risk of using the Internet for the common person in Singapore is to be forced into 
doing things that cannot be taken back. An example can be accidentally pressing the like 
button on a person’s old photo or downloading free software that contains malware. You may
be unable to revert that action because of the lack of forgiveness in the website’s design.
Through learning the various ways your online experience may be compromised, secure yourself against technological harm.
Real life example of an un-reversible action: Torrenting a game illegally,
causing malware adverts to pop up all over the place in browser, as well as words being highlighted and obstructing user’s view while browsing.
